<%# In this page we will be having the form, that the user will fill %>
<%# thats why we implement in the controller @resturant - Restaurant.new %>
<%# it represents an empty instance so that the user can fill it here %>
<%# but we are not yet done, the create takes two methods, new and create %>
<%# here the user will fill the form and in order to submit we need create method %>
<%# since we will use this form multiple of times, we can add patial file in the html and then use render her to use this file %>

<%= simple_form_for @restaurant do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name %>
  <%= f.input :address %>
  <%= f.input :category, collection: %w[chinese italian japanese french belgian] %>
  <%= f.input :phone_number %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>

<%# add a link to take us back to the home page %>
<%= link_to 'Home Page', restaurants_path%>

<%# now we go and create the def create %>
